= RuboCop Packaging

`RuboCop::Packaging` is an extension of [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/),
which is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code formatter.

It contains a set of Cops which enforces some of the guidelines that
are expected of upstream maintainers so that the downstream can build
their packages in a clean environment without any problems.
Some of the other basic guidelines can be found
