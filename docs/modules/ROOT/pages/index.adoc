= RuboCop Packaging

`RuboCop::Packaging` is an extension of [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/), which
is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code formatter.

It helps to enforce some of the guidelines that are expected of upstream maintainers
so that the downstream can build their packages in a clean environment without any problems.

https://packaging.rubystyle.guide[The Packaging Style Guide] lists the cops with some
good and bad examples and the rationale behind these cops can be found in the
https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-packaging/cops_packaging.html[Cops Documentation] section.
